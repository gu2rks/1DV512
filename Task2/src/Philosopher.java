		 * set the seed for this philosopher. To differentiate the seed from the other philosophers, we add the philosopher id to the seed.
		 * the seed makes sure that the random numbers are the same every time the application is executed
		 * the random number is not the same between multiple calls within the same program execution 
		 
		 * NOTE
		 * In order to get the same average values use the seed 100, and set the id of the philosopher starting from 0 to 4 (0,1,2,3,4). 
		 * Each philosopher sets the seed to the random number generator as seed+id. 
		 * The seed for each philosopher is as follows:
		 * 	 	P0.seed = 100 + P0.id = 100 + 0 = 100
		 * 		P1.seed = 100 + P1.id = 100 + 1 = 101
		 * 		P2.seed = 100 + P2.id = 100 + 2 = 102
		 * 		P3.seed = 100 + P3.id = 100 + 3 = 103
		 * 		P4.seed = 100 + P4.id = 100 + 4 = 104
		 * Therefore, if the ids of the philosophers are not 0,1,2,3,4 then different random numbers will be generated.
